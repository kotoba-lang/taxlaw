;; The suite on nbb — the same `.cljc` namespace the JVM runs, on the other
;; runtime, so a ClojureScript-half defect in `kotoba.taxlaw` cannot hide
;; behind a green JVM gate (ADR-2608190100).

;;   nbb --classpath src:test run-tests.cljs
;;
;; This repo is dependency-free, so `src:test` is the whole classpath.
;;
;; Every deftest-bearing namespace has to be named BOTH in the require and
;; in the `run-tests` call: requiring registers the vars, only `run-tests`
;; runs them, and a runner naming a subset prints the same `Ran N tests`
;; shape as one naming all of them.
