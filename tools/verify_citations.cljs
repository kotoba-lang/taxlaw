;; Check every statute cited by `kotoba.taxlaw` against the e-Gov corpus.
;;
;;   nbb tools/verify_citations.cljs [path/to/jp.go.e-gov.elaws]
;;
;; Default corpus path assumes the kotoba-lang workspace layout
;; (`../jp.go.e-gov.elaws`), the same convention labor/psa/shift use.
;;
;; ## Why not just fetch the URLs
;;
;; The earlier version of this check fetched each citation and accepted HTTP
;; 200. That proves the URL resolves. It does not prove the law exists under
;; that id, does not compare the title, and — the one that matters — cannot
;; see that a law has been REPEALED. A repealed statute serves its page with
;; a 200 like any other.
;;
;; The corpus index states all three. It also distinguishes
;; `:law.status/superseded-revision` (the snapshot predates a later revision
;; of a law still in force — fine, and reported separately) from
;; `:law.status/repealed` / `:lapsed` / `:expired`, which are not fine.
;;
;; ## Exit codes are three-valued on purpose
;;
;;   0  every cited statute exists, is in force, and its title matches
;;   1  a citation is bad: absent, repealed/lapsed/expired, or retitled
;;   2  THE RUN COULD NOT ANSWER — the corpus is not on disk, or the index
;;      parsed to nothing. This is the case that must never be reported as
;;      clean. A checker whose corpus is missing has learned nothing about
;;      the citations, and saying "0 problems" would make that
;;      indistinguishable from having checked.
